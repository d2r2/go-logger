Golang logger functionality with package-level logging separation to improve application debug process
======================================================================================================

Functionality of this package is similar to [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) and other popular Golang logging packages, but still the capabilities of this package are not as flexible and advanced as the mentioned popular packages.

One of the reasons for creating this library was the ability to log with more verbosity levels. For instance, we have here Fatal, Panic, Error, Warning, **Notify**, Information and Debug levels, while others ordinary do not include Notify verbosity.

I'll add more information about the API here later, but for now, folks, that's all now.
